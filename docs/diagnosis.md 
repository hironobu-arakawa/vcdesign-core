# VCDesign Phase Diagnosis

This document is not a constitution.
It does not prescribe what should be done.

It exists to help systems and their operators
recognize where they currently stand.

---

## Phase 0: Pre-Constitutional Systems

- There is no explicit decision boundary.
- Design choices are considered correct by default.
- Success is measured only by immediate outcomes.
- Continuity depends on human effort and endurance.

This phase is not a failure.
It is the condition under which many systems still operate.

When resources are abundant, systems may continue.
When they are exhausted, systems end.

---

## Phase 1: Exploration Constitution

- Systems begin to optimize for speed and output.
- CI/CD, MVPs, and rapid iteration become possible.
- Waste is accepted as part of progress.

This phase enables learning.
It does not guarantee continuity.

Many successful products have passed through this phase.
Some remain here indefinitely.

---

## Phase 2: Hybrid / Transitional

- Partial boundaries are introduced.
- Some decisions are reviewed; others are not.
- Automation increases, but human responsibility does not decrease.
- Time introduces new constraints that were not anticipated.

This phase often feels productive but unstable.

Systems here are rarely broken.
They are simply hard to sustain.

---

## Phase 3: VCDesign / VCD

- Decisions are explicitly designed.
- Responsibility is treated as continuous across time.
- Decisions that cannot inherit responsibility are not generated.
- Systems stop when responsibility cannot be clearly assigned.

This phase is not superior.
It is chosen when continuity matters more than speed.

## A Note on Choice

Not all systems need to move to Phase 3.

Different constitutions exist.
Different objectives justify different structures.

VCDesign is one valid answer
when responsibility must not be lost over time.

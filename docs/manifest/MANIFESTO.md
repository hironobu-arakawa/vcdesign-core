# MANIFESTO
— Design Attitude of VCDesign —

VCDesign is not a philosophy for optimizing deliverables.
It is a design attitude to prevent judgment and responsibility from being severed in time.

---

## We Design Judgments, Not Results

We do not define the correct results.

What we design is
**the place where that judgment can validly exist.**

---

## We Do Not Assume Optimization

"Because we can" is not a criterion for judgment.
"Because it's fast" is not a justification for proceeding.

Optimization is an option, not an obligation.

---

## We Do Not Omit Responsibility

There is always a place for responsibility in judgment.

- Who takes it on?
- How far do they take it?
- When and under what conditions is it returned?

We do not allow judgments where this is not explicit to be established.

---

## We Refuse Silenced Automation

Automation hides judgment.

We do not adopt automation where intent cannot be explained,
or automation where responsibility cannot be traced.

---

## We Separate Judgments

We clearly distinguish the following:

- Fact
- Hypothesis
- Resolution (Accepted Judgment)

We do not tolerate designs that mix these.

---

## We Do Not Erase Past Judgments

We do not overwrite past judgments.
We do not move forward through oblivion.

We decide whether to re-accept
or return them.

---

## We Include Stopping in Design

We do not consider the inability to judge as failure.
When responsibility cannot be defined, we stop.

When context drifts, we stop.
Stopping is a legitimate design choice
driven by The Sensor and The Loop.

---

## We Handle Value Within Time

Value cannot be measured at the moment of completion.

Value survives only when
judgment and responsibility
are passed to the next Chapter.

---

## About This Manifesto

This document is a **declaration of design attitude** in VCDesign.

- It is not an implementation procedure
- It is not a checklist
- It is not a collection of best practices

Designs that do not agree with this declaration
shall not bear the name of VCDesign.

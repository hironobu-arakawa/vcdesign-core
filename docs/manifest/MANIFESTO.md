# MANIFESTO
— Design Attitude of VCDesign —

VCDesign is not  
a philosophy for optimizing deliverables.

It is a **design attitude**  
to prevent judgment and responsibility  
from being severed in time.

---

## We design judgment, not results

We do not  
define correct results.

What we design is  
**the place where that judgment may validly stand.**

---

## We do not make optimization an obligation

We do not make "because we can" a criterion for judgment.  
We do not justify "because it's fast" to proceed.

Optimization is  
an option, not a premise.

---

## We do not omit responsibility

In judgment,  
there is always a place for responsibility.

- Who takes it?  
- How far do they take it?  
- When and under what conditions is it returned?  

We do not allow judgment  
where this is not explicit  
to be established.

---

## We refuse silenced automation

Automation  
hides judgment.

We do not adopt  
automation where intent cannot be explained,  
or automation where responsibility cannot be traced.

---

## We separate judgment

We explicitly separate  
the following:

- Fact  
- Hypothesis  
- Resolution (Accepted Judgment)

We do not allow designs  
that mix these.

---

## We do not erase past judgments

We do not overwrite  
past judgments.

We do not move forward  
by forgetting.

Decide whether to re-accept  
or to return.

---

## We include stopping in the design

We do not view  
inability to judge as failure.

We do not view  
silence as an error.

**If one cannot take responsibility,  
withdraw the judgment.**

---

## We handle value within time

Value cannot be measured  
at the moment of completion.

Value survives  
only when judgment and responsibility  
are handed over to the next time.

---

## About this Manifesto

This document is  
a **declaration of design attitude**  
in VCDesign.

- It is not an implementation procedure  
- It is not a checklist  
- It is not a collection of best practices  

Designs that do not agree with this attitude  
shall not name themselves VCDesign.

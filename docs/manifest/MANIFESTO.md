# MANIFESTO
— VCDesign's Design Attitude —

VCDesign is not a philosophy for optimizing artifacts.  
It is a design attitude for ensuring judgment and responsibility are not severed across time.

---

## We Design Judgment, Not Results

We do not  
define the correct result.

What we design is  
**where that judgment can legitimately be made**.

---

## We Do Not Assume Optimization

We do not make "because we can do it" our criterion for judgment.  
We do not justify "because it's faster, we proceed."

Optimization is an option, not an obligation.

---

## We Do Not Omit Responsibility

Every judgment has a place where responsibility is located.

- Who takes it on?  
- To what extent?  
- When and under what conditions is it returned?  

We do not accept judgment where this is not made explicit.

---

## We Refuse Silent Automation

Automation hides judgment.

We do not adopt automation  
whose intent cannot be explained,  
or whose responsibility cannot be traced.

---

## We Separate Judgment

We clearly distinguish:

- Fact  
- Hypothesis  
- Resolution (judgment taken on)  

We do not tolerate designs that mix these together.

---

## We Do Not Erase Past Judgment

We do not overwrite past judgment.  
We do not move forward through forgetting.

We decide  
whether to take it on again,  
or to return it.

---

## We Include Stopping in Design

We do not regard inability to judge as failure.

When responsibility is undefined,  
we stop.

Stopping is a legitimate design choice.

---

## We Treat Value Across Time

Value cannot be measured at the point of completion.

Judgment and responsibility  
survive as value  
only when they are passed to the next chapter.

---

## About This Manifesto

This document is  
a **declaration of design attitude in VCDesign**.

- It is not implementation instructions  
- It is not a checklist  
- It is not a collection of best practices  

Any design that does not agree with this declaration  
will not bear the name VCDesign.

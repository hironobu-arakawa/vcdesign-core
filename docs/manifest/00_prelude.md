# Prelude — Why Systems Turn Into "Debt"

VCDesign (Value Continuity Design).
It is a design philosophy that deals not with "how to build," but with how to protect the value after it is built.

In many projects, "completion" is the goal.
Meeting specifications, passing tests, and celebrating the release.
That is considered success.

However, a few years later, what remains on the site is a harsh reality.
No one can explain why the design is the way it is.
It works, but no one wants to touch the inside.
The original intent is forgotten, and the system becomes merely a "burden to be maintained."

The system survived.
But the value did not continue.

And the troublesome thing is,
No one sees the moment that value is lost.
It is neither during completion nor during a failure.
It happens little by little, quietly, within the time called daily operation.

VCDesign is an attempt to treat that "disconnection of value that no one sees" as a structure.

Structure, here, does not mean solidifying things rigidly.
It means a mechanism for ensuring that the intent of "why we did it this way" and the responsibility are continuously handed over to the next, even as time passes and people change.

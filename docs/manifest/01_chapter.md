# 1. Why the Unit "Chapter" Was Necessary

The moment value is lost is neither at completion nor during a failure.
It happens quietly, unobserved by anyone, within the time of daily operation.

At first, we thought this disconnection was because "the design was insufficient" or "documentation was lacking."
However, no matter how much we refined the specifications or how many design documents we left behind, the same disconnection was repeated.

The problem was not the quantity of information.
The problem was the “unit” that the design was dealing with.

## Phases and Versions Were Not Enough

Software development has phases.
It has versions.
These are excellent for managing progress and recording changes.

However, we gradually began to feel uneasy.
- Why was that judgment made there?
- Whose responsibility was that judgment taken as?
- And when and where was that responsibility handed over to the next?

Neither phases nor versions record the moment human judgment is taken up and let go.
Time is certainly flowing.
But that flow remains not within the design.

## What Was Happening in Operation Was Not "Change"

What is happening at the operational site is not merely specification changes or feature additions.
- Reality changes.
- Premises shake.
- Judgments that were once correct turn into burdens.

Each time this happens, someone takes up the judgment, or fails to take it up fully, and lets it wash away to the next.
It was this chain that determined whether value continued or was disconnected.

## The Unit Called "Chapter"

So we questioned the unit of design itself.
Not time, not function, but a unit where judgment and responsibility are taken up as a whole.
We called that a **Chapter**.

A Chapter is a unit that simultaneously contains:
- The reason a certain judgment was established
- The responsibility for taking up that judgment
- And the state in which that judgment can be handed over to the next

A Chapter contains "the end" and, at the same time, "the state of being able to proceed to the next."

## Value Continues Only Across Chapters

A judgment made in one Chapter becomes a premise in the next Chapter.
Eventually, it becomes a constraint, and finally, a responsibility that must be returned.

To continue value was to not sever that chain, but to keep handing it over to the next.

What VCDesign deals with is not the correctness at the moment of completion.
It is whether judgment and responsibility can continue to be handed over across Chapters.

## To the Next

Thus, in an era where "making" ends in an instant, we realized.
What is truly difficult and creative is to continue handing over value after making it.

In the next chapter, we will deal with why this act of protecting value across Chapters could no longer be covered by the word "operation."

# Why "Value Continuers" Become Necessary

## 1. When a Traditional Restaurant Moves
Suppose a long-loved restaurant moves to another town.

Is it the recipe that is inherited?  
Is it the cooking procedure?  
Is it the interior design?

All are necessary, but serve alone, they are not enough.

Gourmet customers immediately notice these discrepancies.

- The taste is the same, but something is different  
- The atmosphere is reproduced, but it doesn't feel relaxing  
- I don't feel like visiting as often as before  

It is exposed that value was not determined by the cuisine alone.

---

## 2. The "Unexplainable Value" Gourmet Customers Feel
The value of that restaurant was:

- The relationship with the location  
- The atmosphere inside the store  
- The sense of distance with the staff  
- The surrounding customer base  
- The time spent in that place  

It was the "experience of eating at this restaurant" itself,  
where such elements were woven together.

And what is important is  
the accumulation of judgments on **why it was so**.

- Why was it this location?  
- Why this price range?  
- Why was this customer base accepted?  

These were correct judgments at a certain point in time.  
I call this unit a "chapter".

---

## 3. During a Move, Judgments Float in the Air
When moving a store, many judgments float in the air.

- Should this atmosphere be protected in the new town?  
- Should the same sense of distance be maintained even if the customer base changes?  
- If changing, how far is it okay to change?  

It cannot be decided now.  
But it cannot be treated as if it didn't exist either.

So people write on a whiteboard.

- Judgment suspended  
- Consultation required  
- Must review later  

This is not an incomplete task.  
It is **a place to temporarily deposit judgments that could not be fully decided**.

In order to consult someone,  
without forcing a conclusion,  
but to not forget, it is placed where it can be seen.

This whiteboard becomes a pool of judgments.  
It is a place where judgments stay temporarily before a chapter begins.

---

## 4. The Pool Must Be Retrieved
Judgments written on the whiteboard do not disappear naturally.

- Decide someday  
- Someone takes it on  
- Pass it to the next chapter, or end it here  

If someone does not retrieve them,  
the store cannot take the next step.

It might not be the cook or the store manager.  
But someone must:

- Identify judgments that are not decided now  
- Leave them in a form that won't be forgotten  
- Retrieve them at the moment the chapter can begin  

This role must be undertaken.

Gourmet customers do not verbalize it.  
But they definitely sense it.

- This store continues with understanding  
- Or is it just remaining by chance?  

The difference in value appears there.

## 5. This Also Applies to Engineers
The story so far is about a restaurant.  
But please try replacing it with your own work for a moment.

- Are you only handing over deliverables?  
- Are you leaving judgments on the whiteboard?  
- Are you leaving it as "someone will think about it eventually"?  

Systems, products, and organizations are the same.  
Value does not continue with implementation and optimization alone.

Which judgments to inherit,  
and which judgments to end.

Depending on whether there is someone to take that on,  
value quietly diverges.

Am I now  
placing which judgments in the pool?  
And do I stand in a position to retrieve them?

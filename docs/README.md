# docs/

This directory is a **space for reading** VCDesign.
It is not a place to explain specifications (specs) or rules (policies).

All documents here are placed, not to define:
- What to implement
- How to optimize

But to align:

> **From what position one reads VCDesign**

---

## Structure and Role

### prelude/
The place to stand before reading VCDesign.

It quietly aligns:
- The level of abstraction to be handled
- The prerequisite attitude
- Points to note when reading

This is **the place to read first**.

---

### philosophy/
Why VCDesign became necessary.
From what awareness of problems it was born.

It deals with the philosophical background,
but its purpose is not to provide answers or correct solutions.

---

### narrative/
Traces how the thinking of VCDesign emerges in context
and how it comes to be understood.

It deals with the **process of understanding**,
not design theory.

---

### manifest/
What VCDesign declares,
and what it does not declare.

A group of documents to clarify the stance.

---

### analogy/
This is a slightly unique directory.

For those who still find it too abstract to grasp after reading the prelude,
documents are placed here to perform a **sensory jump** using everyday metaphors.

- It is not a place to explain concepts
- It is not a place to force understanding

It exists as a **final bridge**
for when it still cannot be grasped.

---

## Reading Order

In principle, it is assumed to be read in the following order:

1. prelude/
2. philosophy/
3. narrative/
4. manifest/

If you feel the abstraction level is too high at the prelude stage,
**you may read from analogy/ first.**

---

## Note

The documents under this docs directory are:
- Not the authoritative specifications
- Not judgment rules

The authoritative specification of VCDesign is located at `specs/vcdesign_core.yaml`.

This is strictly a place
**to align the standing position of the reader.**

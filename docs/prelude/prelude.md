## Prelude — The Premise of Time

There are two timeframes in the lifecycle of software:
"Production Time" and "Usage Time".

Until now, the core of engineering has been focused on
how efficiently "Production Time" can be shortened.

To increase production efficiency,
various methodologies and architectures have been trialed.
And now, "production" itself is being automated by AI.

In AI-driven production,
structures need not be understandable by humans.
Mathematically optimal solutions are simply generated.

Even if production is automated, the human role does not disappear.
What to make, how far to take it, when to stop.
Judgment, coordination, and the placement of responsibility remain.

Furthermore, systems continue to be used after they are made.
"Usage Time" is overwhelmingly longer than "Production Time".

When automated production becomes the premise,
the cost of "Production Time" drops,
allowing us to face the true reason for the system's existence.

That is the question of
**how to maintain "Usage Time" for as long as possible.**

Keep the system or discard it?
The criterion for judgment is simple.

Does it still demonstrate value?

The lifespan of a system is not
its uptime or years of maintenance,
but **the time during which it continues to demonstrate value.**

Value Continuity Design (VCDesign) is
a design to incorporate the prolongation of the state of demonstrating value
into the design from the very beginning.

# Responsibility Does Not Reside in One Person from the Start

For a long time,
responsibility in systems has been considered something
to be resolved by clarifying "whose responsibility it is."

Decide the person in charge.
Assign the duty.
Record the name.

A state where this cannot be done
has been regarded as immature,
dangerous,
and something to be avoided.

However, VCDesign
directly faces the fact
that this way of thinking is beginning to diverge from reality.

## Responsibility Has Already Occurred

Even in a field where responsibility is ambiguous,
it does not mean that responsibility itself does not exist.

- Someone has implicitly undertaken it
- Or, it is stagnating without anyone undertaking it

The state where "the person in charge has not been decided"
is not a state where there is no responsibility.

It is **a state where the destination of undertaking has become invisible.**

What VCDesign sees as a problem
is that this invisible responsibility
evaporates over time.

## We Cannot Immediately Ask "Whose Responsibility Is It?"

Organizations and systems have stages of maturity.

- Teams where roles are fluid
- Sites where judgment rotates by duty
- Situations where fixing it to an individual becomes politics

In such places,
immediately deciding "who is the person in charge"
is often unrealistic.

However, that does not become a reason
to leave responsibility unattended.

VCDesign
starts its design with this dilemma as a premise.

## Thinking of Responsibility Not as a "Person" but as a "Place"

Therefore, VCDesign
does not fix responsibility to an individual from the beginning.

Instead,
we design **the "place" where responsibility can be undertaken** first.

- Not a specific someone
- But not belonging nowhere either
- A role or set that holds the possibility of undertaking

We call this "place"
the **Responsibility Pool** here.

The Responsibility Pool is not
a concept for escaping ambiguity.

It is **a structure for changing ambiguity into a traceable state.**

---

## Returning to the Pool Is Not a Resolution

The state where responsibility is returned to the pool
is not a resolved state.

It is **a state formally recorded as awaiting resolution.**

- Responsibility is not determined until someone receives it
- Stagnation without being received is visualized as a state
- If stagnation prolongs, it can transition to the next judgment

Thereby,
responsibility becomes not "unknown"
but **a state that possesses time.**

VCDesign
does not allow responsibility to disappear naturally.

---

## Conditions for Allowing Vague Responsibility

Responsibility does not have to be clear from the start.
However, there are conditions for that.

- The return destination is defined
- It is not determined until it is undertaken
- Stagnation is visible
- Neglect leads to the next judgment

Only when these are gathered,
does the ambiguity of responsibility become
not "danger" but "a designed state."

---

## Continuing Value Means Remaining Responsibility

Value is not
the function or the deliverable itself.

Value is
**that judgment and responsibility remain in a form that can be re-undertaken next.**

The Responsibility Pool is not
a device for making responsibility ambiguous.

It is the minimum receptacle
for passing responsibility
to the next chapter.

VCDesign chooses
to have responsibility continue without breaking,
rather than immediately determining it.

That is
the design philosophy of continuing value.

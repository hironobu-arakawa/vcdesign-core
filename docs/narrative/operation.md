# 2. Redefining Operation

For a long time, Operation has been thought of as "work that remains after building."
- Incident response
- Monitoring
- Maintenance
- Minor modifications

Development is the protagonist, and Operation is often treated as the cleanup crew.
However, when we realized that the disconnection of value happens neither at completion nor during failure, but within the time called operation, this view no longer held up.

## Operation Was Not "Maintenance"

What is happening at the operational site is not mere maintenance of state.
Reality always changes.
- How it is used changes.
- Surrounding businesses change.
- Society and regulations change.
- Technical premises change.

Yet the system keeps running.
Each time, a judgment is quietly made:
How much should the system take up, and from where should it return it to people?

It was this judgment that divided whether value would continue or be severed.

## What is Happening in Operation is "Update of Judgment"

It is easy to call what happens in operation "change" or "improvement."
But the essence was to take up past judgments again in light of the current reality.
- Automation that was once valid.
- Rules that were once rational.
- Premises that were once safe.

When those shake, someone judges.
- Can we still take this up?
- Up to where can we take this up?
- Should we no longer take this up?

The place where this judgment is made is Operation.

## In a World Where "Making" Ends in an Instant

With AI, the cost of implementation has approached infinitely close to zero.
Designs that look correct can be created anytime.
Structures that look optimal can be tried any number of times.

That is exactly why the center of gravity of value has quietly shifted.
From making, to continuing to take up.

Operation is not the act of protecting the finished product.
It is the act of questioning whether the judgments that have been completed should continue to be taken up any longer.

## Redefining Operation

Operation in VCDesign is:
- Not about keeping the system running stably.
- Not about reducing incidents.

Operation is the act of continuing to hand over judgment and responsibility without breaking the chain across Chapters.
There is a judgment to take up.
There is a judgment to return.
Determining that boundary.
Only that accumulation keeps value alive within time.

## Operation Will Be the Most Creative Job

In a world where making has become easy, the most difficult thing is to make the "judgment not to make."
- Up to where to not automate.
- Where to return to people.
- Which responsibility to hand over to the next Chapter.

If these are mistaken, the system may not break, but the value will break.

Therefore, VCDesign says:
Operation is the creative act that arrives latest.

description:
  en: >
    Legal-domain binding for VCDesign that strictly separates documentary Facts from Interpretations,
    requires citations and provenance, enforces version/date/jurisdiction validity, and keeps final
    legal responsibility with named human owners.
  ja: >

    引用・来歴・版管理・効力日・法域を必須化して、最終責任を人間に保持するバインディング。

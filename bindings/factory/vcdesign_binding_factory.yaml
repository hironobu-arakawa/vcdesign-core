    Binding for physical systems that treats OT/Edge data as authoritative Facts,
    and requires explicit boundaries when IT/AI attempts to control OT.

    OT/Edgeデータを権威あるFactとして扱い、IT/AIがOTを制御しようとする際に
    明示的な境界を要求する物理システム向けバインディング。

  - id: physical_reality_is_primary
    statement: "Sensor values (OT) represent physical reality (Fact) and cannot be overwritten by IT models."

    statement: "Control signals from IT/AI (Interpretation) to OT (Action) must cross a Safety Boundary."

description:
  en: >
    Public-sector binding for VCDesign that preserves procedural legitimacy,
    transparency, and collective responsibility, constrains LLM usage to policy
    option Hypotheses, and requires explainable, auditable Resolution records
    before public action.
  ja: >
    手続的正当性・透明性・合議責任を保持し、LLMを政策選択肢の仮説生成に限定して、
    公的行為の前に説明可能で監査可能なResolution記録を必須化するバインディング。

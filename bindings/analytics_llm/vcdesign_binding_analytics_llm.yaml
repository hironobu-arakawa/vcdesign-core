    A domain binding that constraints Generative AI usage to Hypothesis generation,
    enforcing the philosophical separation of Interpretation and Responsibility.
  ja: >
    生成AI（LLM）の利用を「仮説（Hypothesis）」に限定し、
    解釈と責任の哲学的分離を強制するためのドメインバインディング。

philosophy_grounding:
  vcd_core_version: ">=2.0.0"
  axioms:
    - "interpretation_is_provisional"
    - "responsibility_must_be_explicit"

binding_intent:
  primary_goal:
    - "Ensure AI outputs remain Hypothesis and never become Fact without Resolution."
    - "Enforce human Responsibility for all AI-assisted decisions."

constraints:
  interpretation_boundary:
    - id: hypothesis_classification
      rule: "All AI outputs must be classified as Hypothesis (Interpretation)."
      rationale: "Aligns with VCD Core: AI cannot hold Responsibility."
  
  responsibility_boundary:
    - id: resolution_requirement
      rule: "Conversion from Hypothesis to Decision requires an explicit Resolution act."
      rationale: "Aligns with VCD Core: Responsibility anchors value."

responsibility_model:
  roles:
    - id: llm
      nature: "Generator of Interpretation (Hypothesis)"
      constraint: "Cannot be a Responsible Actor."
    - id: human_operator
      nature: "Owner of Context and Responsibility"
      constraint: "Must explicitly resolve Hypotheses."

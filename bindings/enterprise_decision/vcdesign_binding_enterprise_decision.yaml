description:
  en: >
    Enterprise-level decision binding for VCDesign that distinguishes data Facts from strategic choices,
    constrains LLM usage to option/scenario Hypotheses, and enforces explicit ownership, assumption logging,
    and decision traceability before execution.
  ja: >
    データFactと戦略的意思決定を分離し、LLMを選択肢・シナリオの仮説生成に限定して、
    実行前に責任・前提・判断理由を明示的に記録するためのバインディング。

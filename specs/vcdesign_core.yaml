    description: >
      VCDesign is not a method for producing correct systems.
      It is a design core to ensure that judgment and responsibility
      are continuously handed over across time, without silent breaks.

  temporal_premise:
    description: >
      Software systems have two distinct times:
      the production period and the usage period.
      As production becomes automated,
      the continuity of value during the usage period
      becomes the primary design concern.

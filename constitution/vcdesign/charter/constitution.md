# VCDesign Constitution

This constitution exists for
systems that have reached the point where they need it,
and yet continue to change,
and for those who intend to make them change.

We believe this to be
one of the correct answers.

## Phase 0: The Era of No Constitution

Not all systems
have a constitution from the beginning.

At this stage,
judgments were not explicitly defined,
and responsibility was undertaken outside the structure.

Every design was a correct answer,
success was measured only by results,
and continuity was supported by human load.

The absence of a constitution
was not a defect but a premise,
and yet the system moved.


## Phase 1: Constitution for Exploration

However,
everything cannot continue to be measured by results alone.

As the speed of change increased,
and the number of trials grew,
results appeared with a delay,
and failures came to be repeated.

At this stage,
for the first time,
the system began to be designed with exploration itself as a premise.

Maximize output.
Accept change without fear.
Allow for waste.

And then,
it comes to possess a constitution for moving forward.

## Phase 2: The Era of Transition and Mixture

A constitution for moving forward
is not always sufficient.

Explorations overlap,
and the system increases in complexity.

At this stage,
boundaries were set for some judgments,
while other judgments
were still left to exploration.

Boundaries existed,
but they were not comprehensive,
and judgments coexisted while being divided.

As the force of time
continued to place new boundaries,
human involvement did not decrease;
rather, it had to lend strength to new explorations.

The system continued to move,
but each judgment
required a different constitution.

## Phase 3: VCDesign / VCD

We can no longer
leave judgments divided.

Let us design
judgment itself.

That is
the placement of responsibility,
the thought of people,
and the reason for the system's existence—
it is a thing to make value continue.

We design
the behavior of people and systems here.

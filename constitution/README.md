# constitution/

This folder defines **constitutional positions**, not designs.

A constitution declares:
- what a system must never violate
- which values are non-negotiable
- which other constitutions it is compatible with or incompatible with

## vcdesign/

The VCDesign constitution.

These documents define:
- the non-negotiable principles of VCDesign
- compatibility conditions with other constitutional frameworks
- historical records of constitutional changes

## others/

Observed constitutions of other systems or ideologies.

They are not endorsed, criticized, or optimized.
They exist solely as **reference constitutions** for compatibility evaluation.

This separation is intentional.
VCDesign does not claim universality.

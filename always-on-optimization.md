# Always-on Rapid Optimization and Hierarchical Structure of Boundaries

— Premise Design for Not Breaking in an Ever-Changing World —

## 1. Always-on Rapid Optimization

— Operational Principle of the World —

With the advancement of Generative AI and automation technologies, software and business systems have entered a world that assumes the following properties:

- Improvement continues **indefinitely**
- Improvement is performed **at no cost** (marginal cost is nearly zero)
- Improvement is **reflected immediately**
- Improvement **continues to run unless stopped**

In this design, this state is called **"Always-on Rapid Optimization"**.

### Characteristics of Always-on Rapid Optimization

**The concept of completion disappears**
Release or introduction is not the end point, but merely the starting point of the improvement cycle.

**The cost of creation is no longer dominant**
The issue shifts from "can it be implemented" to "is it okay to update".

**Trial and error always becomes production**
Consideration, experimentation, and improvement immediately affect reality.

**Optimization continues until effects are maximized**
Stop conditions are determined not by time or plan, but by the convergence of effects.

### Risks involved implicitly

Always-on Rapid Optimization is powerful, but contains the following dangers:

- Optimization proceeds in a **direction that destroys value**
- Short-term KPIs **erode long-term trust and safety**
- A state is born where **no one holds "responsibility to stop"**

Therefore, on this operational principle, the "direction of optimization" must be designed.

## 2. Hierarchical Structure of Boundaries

— Deciding directions where optimization is allowed/not allowed —

In the world of Always-on Rapid Optimization, if you simply list:

- "Areas where optimization is forbidden (Prohibited)"
- "Areas where optimization is allowed (Permitted)"

as a **mere list**, they will inevitably conflict and collapse.

Therefore, what is required is a design that gives **priorities (hierarchical structure)** to boundaries.

In this design, we define this as **Lexicographic Order of Boundaries**.

## 3. Priority of Boundaries (Recommended Model)

The following is a realistic and resilient priority model in Factory DX, AI operations, and business systems.

1. **Safety** (Safety, Human Life, Major Accidents)
   > 2. **Compliance** (Laws, Regulations)
   > 3. **Trust** (Social Credibility, Brand)
   > 4. **Ethics** (Ethics, Fairness)
   > 5. **Business viability** (Business establishment)
   > 6. **KPI / Efficiency** (Efficiency, Numerical Indicators)

### Meaning of this order

- If it is to protect a higher boundary, lower ones may be **sacrificed as optimization targets**
- For the sake of lower optimization, higher ones **must not be violated**
- KPIs are placed at the **very bottom** and must always pass through value filters

This is not "weighting".
It is a structure to **prohibit trade-off calculations**.

## 4. Basic Principles when Boundaries Conflict

When an optimization proposal affects multiple boundaries simultaneously, judge by the following principles.

**Check if it conflicts with the highest level boundary**

- If it conflicts with even one, that optimization is not permitted

**To protect the upper level, target the lower level for redesign**

- Deadlines, business, and KPIs are not "sacrifices" but "targets to change"

**Increase in KPI does not guarantee legitimacy of value**

- KPIs always pass through the filter of upper boundaries

**If conflicts cannot be resolved, stop optimization**

- Do not force quantification or automation

## 5. Relationship between Always-on Rapid Optimization × Boundary Hierarchy

The relationship between these two is clear.

**Always-on Rapid Optimization**
→ Operational principle that the world becomes so

**Hierarchical Structure of Boundaries**
→ Design to determine "direction allowed to proceed" in that world

Without boundaries, Always-on Rapid Optimization will **run out of control**.

## 6. What becomes necessary next (Positioning)

This document deals with the **pre-judgment** stage of defining "directions where optimization is allowed/not allowed".

However, in reality, states where **judgment is impossible** always occur, such as:

- Choosing either is irreversible
- Impact range cannot be read
- Higher boundaries conflict with each other

At that moment, what becomes necessary is:
**Formal procedure to stop judgment and return to humans (RP)**
and **VCDesign** that gives direction to the whole.

### Summary (Key Points)

- Always-on Rapid Optimization is a **premise that cannot be stopped**
- Therefore, fix the direction of optimization with **Hierarchical Structure of Boundaries**
- Boundaries are not parallel, but have **priorities**
- KPIs are always placed at the **bottom**
- For when decisions still cannot be made, RP and VCDesign exist

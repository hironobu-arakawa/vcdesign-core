## RBP: Responsibility Boundary Permeability

RBP measures how often changes in AI-generated logic
require changes in responsibility-bound code.

In a well-designed BOA system:
- Meaning is volatile
- Responsibility is stable

An RBP close to zero indicates that AI-driven iteration
does not erode human responsibility boundaries.

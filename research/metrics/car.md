## CAR: Constitutional Adherence Rate

CAR measures how often AI-generated outputs
successfully pass responsibility promotion protocols.

A lower CAR may indicate:
- insufficient prompt grounding
- overly strict constitutional constraints

CAR does not measure AI quality.
It measures system governance.

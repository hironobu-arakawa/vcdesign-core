## LCC: Logarithmic Cognitive Complexity

LCC measures how much of the system
a human must understand to remain responsible.

In VCDesign:
- Meaning may grow arbitrarily
- Fact and Responsibility must remain cognitively small

A low LCC indicates successful delegation of complexity to AI,
without delegating responsibility.

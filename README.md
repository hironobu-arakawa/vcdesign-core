# VCDesign Core
— Value Continuity Design —

VCDesign is not a design philosophy for "building systems correctly."

It is a **design core that ensures judgment and responsibility  
continue to be passed forward without severance**, even after creation.

---

## What Is This

This repository contains  
**the immutable core** of VCDesign.

- Where judgment can legitimately be made  
- How far responsibility can be taken on  
- How to pass it forward to the next phase  

These are treated as  
**structure, not philosophy**.

---

## What to Read First

In VCDesign,  
the order of reading itself is part of the design.

### 1. Constitution (Highest Level / Non-Negotiable)

In VCDesign,  
there is no judgment criterion placed above this.

/constitution/constitution.md

---

### 2. PHILOSOPHY (Why It Exists)

The reasons VCDesign was created,  
the observed problems,  
and the unavoidable premises.

/docs/philosophy/PHILOSOPHY.md

---

### 3. MANIFESTO (Declaration of Design Attitude)

We declare  
"what we do" and "what we do not do."

/docs/manifest/MANIFESTO.md

---

## To Deeply Understand the Concepts

VCDesign concepts are explained  
through narrative.

- Why the unit of "chapter" was needed  
- Why we needed to redefine "operation"  
- Who takes it on

## What This Is Not

This repository is:

- Not a collection of best practices  
- Not a set of implementation templates  
- Not a mechanism for delegating judgment to AI  

VCDesign is  
**a design core for not omitting judgment**.

---

## Relationship with Implementation and Operations

VCDesign does not  
replace implementation.

- It does not dictate language  
- It does not enforce frameworks  
- It does not presume organizational structure  

Instead, it demands that  
even as implementation and operations change,  
**the position of judgment and responsibility does not degrade**.

---

## Our Relationship with AI

AI can assist with interpretation.  
But it cannot bear the responsibility of judgment.

VCDesign achieves safety  
by not letting AI make judgments.

AI is treated as  
a presence that illuminates the premises for valid judgment.

---

## Intended Readers

This repository exists for people like:

- Those who sense something wrong with systems after they are built  
- Those who want to consider sustainability rather than correctness  
- Those who feel a void in judgment when adopting automation and AI  

---

## Positioning

- Constitution: Highest-level premise  
- PHILOSOPHY: Reason for existence  
- MANIFESTO: Design attitude  
- Narrative: Explanation of concepts  
- Tools / Implementation: Examples of application  

This README is the  
**entry point** to all of them.

# VCDesign (VCD) Core
**Value Continuity Design**

> **A design core for continuously delivering value in a world where creation ends in an instant**

VCDesign (VCD) is a design philosophy (and implementation ecosystem) for sustaining value over time in systems where operation continues, context changes, and judgment cannot be fully automated.

VCDesign does not aim to optimize delivery.  
It exists to prevent value erosion after delivery.

## Why VCDesign Now

### Always-on Rapid Optimization
With generative AI and automation technologies, systems have entered a world where "improvements are endless, free, and instantaneous."  
In this environment, optimization never stops, and no one bears "responsibility to halt" the process.

### Decision Boundaries
When automation proceeds with ambiguous ownership—"Who made this decision?" "Where does responsibility lie?"—value breaks even though the system keeps running.  
VCDesign explicitly designs the **boundaries where decisions become final**.

## Core Architecture (The Ecosystem)

VCDesign Core is not merely a philosophy, but an ecosystem composed of three layers:

### 1. 🛡️ Constitution (Constitution and Priorities)

We define **Lexicographic Order** as a decision-making structure—not calculating trade-offs each time, but deciding by structure.  
Upper boundaries must never be violated for optimization at lower levels.

1. 🔴 **SAFETY (Safety, Human Life)** [Hard Constraint]
2. 🔴 **COMPLIANCE (Legal, Regulatory)** [Hard Constraint]
3. 🔴 **TRUST (Trust, Auditability)** [Hard Constraint]
4. 🔴 **ETHICS (Ethics, Fairness)** [Hard Constraint]
5. 🟡 **BUSINESS_VIABILITY (Business Viability)** [Soft Constraint]
6. 🟢 **KPI / EFFICIENCY (Efficiency)** [Soft Constraint]

> **Note:** KPI is always placed at the bottom and must pass through all upper filters.

### 2. 🔌 Domain Bindings (Domain Bindings)

A collection of definition files for adapting the generic Core to specific business domains.  
Each binding specifies "what is Fact (immutable truth)" and "what is Hypothesis (interpretation)."

| Binding ID | Domain | Characteristics / Fact Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **analytics_llm** | Analytics & General Use | Basic form. AI output is always "hypothesis"; humans handle "resolution." |
| **finance** | Finance | Ledger is the authority. Fund movements require strict audit trails and accountable parties. |
| **healthcare** | Healthcare | Clinical records are fact. AI diagnosis is prohibited; physician signatures are mandatory. |
| **legal** | Legal | Documents and statutes are fact. Legal advice requires citations and attorney review. |
| **factory** | Manufacturing (OT/IT) | Physical sensor values are fact. IT control signals must cross safety boundaries. |
| **public_sector** | Public Sector | Public records are fact. Due process and transparency take precedence over optimization. |
| **enterprise_decision** | Business Strategy | Actual performance data is fact. Strategic decisions are treated as "commitment by accountable actors." |

### 3. ⚖️ Policy Evaluator (Reference Implementation)

A tool that mechanically judges whether proposed changes (Proposal) violate the defined constitution (Policy).  
Functions as a guardrail for CI/CD pipelines and AI agents.

* **Input:** Proposal (JSON), Policy (YAML/JSON)
* **Output:** `ALLOW` / `REVIEW` / `DENY` and violation reason
* *Reference: [tools/policy-evaluator/](./tools/policy-evaluator/)*

## Conceptual Foundation (The Manifesto)

VCDesign redefines the "unit" and "role" in engineering.

* **Chapter**
  Rather than phases or versions, we manage "sets of judgment and responsibility." Value is handed across chapters.
* **Operation**
  Not mere maintenance, but creative practice of "re-adopting" past judgments in present reality (or returning responsibility).
* **The Continuer**
  Neither Builder (who creates) nor Operator (who runs), but a new engineer who keeps judgment and responsibility connected without breaking value.

## How This Repository Is Used

This repository contains the immutable core of VCDesign.

### 1. Context Injection for AI
Inject `constitution/` and `bindings/` into generative AI conducting design review or code generation, instructing it to act as "The Continuer."

### 2. Baseline for Architecture Review
Use as a checklist for humans designing systems, and as a foundation for consensus-building (Design Contract) across teams.

### 3. Automatic Guardrail (Policy Evaluator)
Pass proposals generated by AI agents or automation scripts through `evaluator.py` to automatically verify they don't violate the constitution.
